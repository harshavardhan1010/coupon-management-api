# Coupon Management API

In this task I tried to implement only few API's like getall,get by coupon id, deletion and creation of coupon

# Things which are implemented

1) Creation of Coupon based on coupon type provided by the user
2) Basic exception handling like coupon not found and throwing exception when same kind of coupon already exists in system

# Things which are not implemented

1) POST of applicable-coupons and apply-coupon/{id}
2) Update of already existing coupon
